##**<ins>Entity Description:</ins>**

**Entity Class:** Green

**Description:** Entity 002 is a small round object, approx. 29.5 inches (75 cm) in circumference, with no visible ridges, cuts, or scratches to its surface. Entity 002 appears as a light blue color, with a metallic touch. Despite all attempts, Entity 002 has shown to be extremely resistant to burning, freezing, dropping, collisions with other objects of any size, or compression.

When in the proximity of Entity 002, Test Subjects reported hearing sounds consisting of steady beeping and long tones and pauses. Upon further research, the sounds were found to have a similar resemblance to Morse code, however, all attempts to decode the beeps have shown inconclusive. Additionally, an audible conversation can be heard, however, the words are unintelligible and seem to show an unknown language when shown on a spectrogram. 

Entity 002 is not hostile towards anyone or anything and is incapable of movement. Entity 002 has been proven to be not sentient or capable of any speech aside from the usual noises it emits.
