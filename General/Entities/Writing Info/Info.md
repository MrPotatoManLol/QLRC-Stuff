# Entity Writing Info

### Entity Submission
When submitting an entity, use the Entity Format to properly format the file.  
State whether the entity is hostile , docile, or neutral when submitting the file.  
Do not delete anything in the file unless told to.  
Replace **Entity XXX** with the entity number **(001 - 999)**. Entity numbers can be changed by the Development Team when needed.  
Replace **MM/DD/XXXX** with the Month **(MM - 01 for Jan. to 12 for Dec.)**, **Day (DD)**, and keep the year as **XXXX**  
Put the **Entity Description** under the **Entity Description** marking in the file.

**If the entity suggestion is accepted, the following will apply:**  
The Development Team can change formatting things in the file **(i.e. improper formatting)**, but will inform you and/or request any actual entity changes **(i.e. Entity description/behavior or containment procedures)**.  
If the Development Team makes any changes, it will be confirmed with you before final submission.  
The development team will determine the proper **clearance level** and **entity class** upon reviewing the entity submission.
