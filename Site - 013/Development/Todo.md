Just a list to keep track of stuff I need to do

- Finish pipes S1B, RSHZ
- Add RSHZ Outside Area
- Add wall decor S1A,B
- Vents instead of tunnels?
- Fix doors - Make movement smooth
- Need to add breach shelter
- Need escape route for RS, probably somewhere in RSHZ
- Make S2 roof/ceiling look decent
