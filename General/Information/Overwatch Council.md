## QLRC Overwatch Council

The Overwatch Council is composed of Corporation Personnel ranking CL-X (Class - X).

CL-X Personnel may only be in the department they lead. This does not apply if said CL-X Personnel is CL-X via the Department of Administration Manufacturing Branch.

In changing the QLRC Articles, The Administrator's authority falls under the same authority as the Overwatch Council, unless explicitly required to overthrow authority.
