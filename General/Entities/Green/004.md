**<ins>Entity Description</ins>**

**Entity Class:** Green </br>
**Description:** Entity 004 is a red marker of unknown origin, approximately 144 mm in height, and 15.5 mm in diameter. Entity 004 behaves like a regular marker, writing and drawing like a normal marker. When empty, any drawings and writing made by Entity 004 are erased no matter their distance from the marker, or how many times the marker was used. Following this, Entity 004 will instantly refill ink, and continue writing as normal. If the drawing is erased before the marker runs out of ink, the exact amount of ink used will instantly appear back in the marker.


**<ins>Containment Procedures</ins>**

Entity 004 is to be contained in a standard object containment cell, surrounded by white padding on the ceiling, floor, and walls. All uses are to be recorded, and anything drawn is to be documented and logged.

No additional containment procedures are necessary, as Entity 004 shows no threat to anyone or anything.
